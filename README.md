# Dash_Test
Python repository for learning the creation of interactive dashboards using the [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) framework. 

## Installation
- Have a working Python3 environment

- You will need to install [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

- additional packages can be installed using the command _pip install \<package\>_

## Contents

Currently the only code available is in the _app.py_ Python script.
It is suggested to first get that one running successfully.
I have included a mock data.csv file for drag & dropping into the app to test everything is working as intended.
